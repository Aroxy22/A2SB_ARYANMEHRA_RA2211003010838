TRACK NAME: OPEN INNOVATION 

PROBLEM STATEMENT: Small-scale farmers in India face challenges like low profit margins, limited market reach, and inadequate access to crucial information. Our AI-driven online marketplace empowers them by providing direct market access, crop prediction, disease detection, and precise fertilizer recommendations, enhancing productivity and ensuring sustainable agricultural practices.

INTRODUCTION: In India's agricultural sector, small-scale farmers face significant challenges, including limited access to fair markets, reduced profitability, and a lack of timely, accurate information on crop management. Dependence on traditional practices and intermediaries like APMCs (Agricultural Produce Market Committees) often results in low profit margins and restricted market access. As AI-driven tools gain prominence in enhancing agricultural productivity, we introduce an online marketplace tailored for small-scale farmers. This platform not only facilitates direct buying and selling of produce, offering higher profit margins and independence from APMCs, but also incorporates AI-driven features such as crop prediction, disease detection, and fertilizer recommendations.

PROBLEM SOLUTION: The proposed solution empowers small-scale farmers by connecting them directly with buyers through a platform that eliminates intermediaries, ensuring higher profit margins. It integrates AI-driven crop management tools, including crop prediction, disease detection, and fertilizer recommendations. Advanced algorithms analyze historical data, soil conditions, and weather patterns to recommend optimal crops, boosting yield potential. AI models diagnose plant diseases early through image analysis, minimizing crop losses and enhancing productivity. Additionally, personalized fertilizer suggestions based on soil data and crop type optimize soil health and reduce costs. The platform further expands market reach by connecting farmers with urban markets and bulk buyers, fostering greater autonomy and control over sales. These integrated solutions enhance profitability, crop management, and market access, transforming the agricultural practices and economic outcomes of small-scale farmers.
